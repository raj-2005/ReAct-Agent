## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a lightweight, backend-only **LangGraph agent** powered by the **GROQ API**. Built using Python, the agent leverages LangGraph’s composable node-based structure to handle stateful reasoning, decision flow, and tool calling — ideal for building scalable and fast AI agents.

> Designed to demonstrate the core of building an autonomous AI agent using LangGraph + GROQ, without frontend complexity.
